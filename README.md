# mask-detection

## Description
This repository contains the results of my Bachelors thesis. It is an image classification model (Convolutional Neural Network) to classify persons wearing a mask or no mask.
It contains the dataset, Data Augmentation, Training and Test. 

## Instructions
- Use data_augmentation.ipynb to perform Data Augmentation on training dataset.
- tensorflow_model.ipynb contains the model structure as well as training.
- The model was trained on the data in masks_dataset. This directory contains original images as well as augmented images which were used to train the model.
- To test to model use model_test.ipynb to receive accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC-curve, AUC.
